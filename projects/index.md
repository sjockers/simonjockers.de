## [COP 21 Fractions](https://correctiv.org/en/blog/2015/12/01/climate-change-factions/us)

This is a recent example of the data viz work we do at correctiv.org and one of the rare pieces we’ve published in English. It accompanied our reporting on the COP21 conference on climate change in Paris. It is also a homage to GapMinder’s famous interactive on the "Wealth & Health of Nations“, popularized by Hans Rosling.

Click on "linear scale" for maximum effect.

The data research for the piece was done by my coworkers Stefan Wehrmeyer and Annika Joeres. I designed it and wrote most of the code.

The code for this project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/correctiv/klimafraktionen). It has since been [reused by OneWorld magazine](https://www.oneworld.nl/wereld/we-moeten-internetvrijheid-koesteren) in Holland to visualize the state of internet censorship access across the world.

## [Weisse Wölfe](http://weisse-woelfe-comic.de/)

"Weisse Wölfe" is a report on right-wing terrorism in Europe, disguised as a graphic novel. It was written by David Schraven and illustrated by Jan Feindt. I designed and build this website which gives the core findings of the report and promotes the book. At weisse-woelfe-comic.de/lesen you can read the full book on your desktop, tablet or mobile.

I like this website because it was a super-quick project that still had a lot of effect. For this project we won the "Reporterpreis" for innovation, a prestigious German journalism award.


## [Ernte Teilen](https://ernte-teilen.org/map)

ernte-teilen.org is a simple web application that maps out community-supported agriculture (CSA) in Germany. Before the project, CSA initiatives found members mostly by word-of-mouth. With ernte-teilen.org, farmers and CSA initiatives can put their farms and food hubs on a map with a short profile. Consumers can find food hubs in their neighborhoods.

ernte-teilen.org is a side-project i’ve been working on and off for three years now. I did all of the visual design and a lot of the web development. Most of the backend development was done by Christian Rijke and Tobias Preuss. The project was started with a small grant from Open Knowledge Germany and is now part of their codefor.de program.
