This news app makes data from the official inspection reports of 13,000 German nursing homes available to the public. It is part of a CORRECTIV investigation into the nursing home system in Germany. My colleague Sandhya Kambhampati has written a detailed description of what we did for the [Open News Source blog](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/investigating-germanys-13000-good-nursing-homes/).

I designed the user interface and developed the frontend for the web application. Backend development by Stefan Wehrmeyer.
