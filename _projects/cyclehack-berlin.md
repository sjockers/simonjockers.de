CycleHack is a global initiative that aims at making cities more sustainable by reducing the barriers to cycling. I co-founded the Berlin CycleHack chapter and organized our first two [48h hackathons](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cyclehackber/albums/72157669689597772) in June 2016 and September 2017, with some help from [Open Knowledge Germany](Open Knowledge Germany) and [FabLab Berlin](https://www.fablab.berlin/).

I also designed and developed a simple website promoting the event. Photos by Matthias Grytzka and Louis-P. Huard.
