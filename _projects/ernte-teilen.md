    text: "The community-supported agriculture model connects farmers and consumers: A group of consumers subscribe to the harvest of a certain farm. In return, they receive a weekly box of produce through a local food hub. The ernte-teilen.org website explains this concept and makes it easier for consumers to join a CSA farm."

    text: In the past, CSA initiatives in Germany found members mostly through word of mouth. With ernte-teilen.org, farmers and CSA initiatives can put their farms and food hubs on a map with a short profile. Consumers can find food hubs in their neighborhoods.

[ernte-teilen.org](https://ernte-teilen.org/) is a web application that maps out [community-supported agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture) in Germany. It is a project I have co-founded and led for several years. I am in charge of product design and have done most of the frontend development. Most of the backend development was done by Christian Rijke. The visual design recently received an overhaul by Maria Dolecek.

The project was started with a [micro grant](http://stadtlandcode.de/) from Open Knowledge Germany and has received funding through their [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de/).
