    text: In the past, CSA initiatives in Germany found members mostly through word of mouth. With ernte-teilen.org, farmers and CSA initiatives can put their farms and food hubs on a map with a short profile. Consumers can find food hubs in their neighborhoods.

[ernte-teilen.org](https://ernte-teilen.org/) is a web application that maps out  [community-supported agriculture \(CSA\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture) in Germany. It is a side-project I have been working on and off for several years.

I did the visual design and a lot of the frontend development for this project. Most of the backend development was done by Christian Rijke and Tobias Preuss. The project was started with a [small grant from Open Knowledge Germany](http://stadtlandcode.de/).
