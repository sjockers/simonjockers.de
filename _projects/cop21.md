This is an example of the data viz work I did for CORRECTIV and one of the rare pieces we published in English. This interactive graphic maps nations on a scatter plot according to their GDP, population and annual CO2 emissions. It was part CORRECTIV’s reporting on the [2015 UN climate change conference](http://www.parisprotokoll.de/).

The data research for the piece was done by Stefan Wehrmeyer and Annika Joeres. I designed it and wrote most of the code. Additional web development was done by Christopher Möller and Moritz Klack.
