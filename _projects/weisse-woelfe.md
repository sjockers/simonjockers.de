“Weisse Wölfe” is a report on right-wing terrorism in Europe, disguised as a graphic novel. It was written by David Schraven and illustrated by Jan Feindt. I designed and built the website for the project which presents the core findings of the report using extracts from the graphic novel. We also made the full book accessible online.

For this project we won the “Reporterpreis” for innovation, a prestigious German journalism award.
