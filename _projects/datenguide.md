    text: The objective of the Datenguide project is to make official statistics about German states, districts, and municipalities more accessible and user-friendly. To achieve this, we build open-source software and try to explain official statistics data in a way that enables more people to work with it.

    text: Since 2018, we have worked on software tools that allow users to download official statistics data and use it for their own data analysis and visualizations. In addition, we have experimented with visual explainers and have conducted workshops and hackathons with journalists and other users of official statistics.

Datenguide is your guide to understanding and using German official statistics. 

With this project, we aim to make German official statistics more accessible to the public. I have co-founded Datenguide with [Simon Wörpel](https://simonwoerpel.de/) and have worked on it on and off since 2018. Additional contributions by [Patricia Ennenbach](https://twitter.com/pen1710), [Christian Rijke](https://christianrijke.de/), and many others. The project has received funding from the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de/), [MIZ Babelsberg](https://www.miz-babelsberg.deprototy), and the [Netzwerk Recherche GROW stipend](https://netzwerkrecherche.org/ziele/gemeinnuetziger-journalismus/grow-stipendien/). 

We are currently in the process of figuring out how to sustain this project in the long term. Follow the project on [GitHub](http://github.com/datenguide/datenguide) or subscribe to our [newsletter](https://datengui.de/#mc-embedded-subscribe-form) to receive updates about the project.
