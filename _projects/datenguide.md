    text: We are working on a modern, easy-to-use statistical data portal aimed at regular people. A website that allows for exploratory browsing, provides explanations and context about the statistics it presents, and lets you download data sets in formats that you can readily use in your own projects.

    text: The German statistics offices already publish their data in official data portals. The problem is that these data portals are expert systems, made by and for bureaucrats. While the official data portals get the job done for people who know what they are doing, they are hardly usable for less tech- and data-savy people. Also, none of the data portals provide modern, easy-to-use APIs or machine-readable data formats, which makes it hard to use the data in your own work. This is where Datenguide comes in. We want to take the pain out of official statistics by presenting them in a way that is usable and useful for you.
