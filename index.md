Hi, Iâ€™m Simon. I design and build web applications with a focus on **civic tech** and **data journalism** projects. 

For the past few years, my day job has been [Datawrapper](https:/datawrapper.de), where we work on tools that let you make your own [charts and maps](https://www.datawrapper.de/solutions/media). 

Outside of my day-to-day, I run [Datenguide](http://datengui.de/), an initiative that aims to make German official statistics more accessible, and [Ernte&nbsp;teilen](https://ernte-teilen.org/), a website that maps community-supported agriculture in German-speaking countries. I also co-organize [Hacks/Hackers Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Berlin/), a series of events on journalism and technology.
