Hi, Iâ€™m Simon. I design and build web applications and interactive graphics at [correctiv.org](https://correctiv.org), a journalism non-profit based in Berlin. I also work on making German official statistics [more accessible](http://datengui.de/) to normal people, co-organize a series of [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Berlin/) about the future of media, and occasionally speak at [conferences](/speaking/).

Outside of my day-to-day job, I co-organize [CycleHack Berlin](http://cyclehackberlin.de/), a hackathon around bikes and bicycle advocacy, and run [ernte-teilen.org](https://ernte-teilen.org/), a website that maps out community-supported agriculture in Germany.
