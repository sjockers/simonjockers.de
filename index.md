Hi, Iâ€™m Simon. I design and build web applications with a focus on civic tech and data journalism projects. More recently, I have been working on making [official statistics](http://datengui.de/) more accessible to normal people, have co-organized a series of [events](https://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Berlin/) on journalism and technology, and have occasionally spoken at [conferences](/speaking/).

Outside of my day-to-day work, I co-organize [CycleHack Berlin](http://cyclehackberlin.de/), a hackathon around bikes and bicycle advocacy, and run [ernte-teilen.org](https://ernte-teilen.org/), a website that maps out community-supported agriculture in Germany.
