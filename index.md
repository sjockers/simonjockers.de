Hello, Iâ€™m Simon Jockers. I design and build web applications and interactive graphics at [correctiv.org](https://correctiv.org), a journalism non-profit based in Berlin. I also co-organize a series of [meetups](http://www.meetup.com/DDJ-Taskforce-NRW/) about data-driven journalism and occasionally speak at conferences.

Outside of my day-to-day job, I co-organize [CycleHack Berlin](http://cyclehackberlin.de/), a hackathon around bicycle advocacy, and run [ernte-teilen.org](https://ernte-teilen.org/), a website that maps out community-supported agriculture in Germany.
